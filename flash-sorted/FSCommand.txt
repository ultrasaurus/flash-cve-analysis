Since we know that  |    standalone_update.htm is exec, this implies that swf_clear.htm is  |    really the exec issue.  However, swf_clear.html doesn't  |    mention fscommand (""exec"") AT ALL, which casts doubt or at  |    least uncertainty as to my conclusions.  |      |    swf_clear.html links back to standalone_update.htm, so at  |    least the references are circular.  |      |    At least it's pretty clear that this issue is different from  |    CVE-2002-0476.  |      |    Email inquiry sent to Macromedia on June 13, 2002."
