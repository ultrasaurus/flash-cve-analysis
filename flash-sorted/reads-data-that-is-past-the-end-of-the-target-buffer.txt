CVE-2017-11213,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier versions. This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer due to an integer overflow; the computation is part of the abstraction that creates an arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap image. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.","BID:101837   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101837   |   CONFIRM:https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-33.html   |   GENTOO:GLSA-201711-13   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201711-13   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2017:3222   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3222   |   SECTRACK:1039778   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039778",Assigned (20170713),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
